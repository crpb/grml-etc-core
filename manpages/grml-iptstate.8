.SH "NAME"
grml-iptstate \- startup wrapper script around iptstate
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B grml-iptstate
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B grml-iptstate
command.
.SH OPTIONS
grml-iptstate does not support any options.
.SH PURPOSE OF grml-iptstate
iptstate (a top-like display of IP Tables state table entries) requires
a present kernel module named ip_conntrack, otherwise it does not start.
To be able to autostart iptstate on grml (especially in live-cd mode) this
wrapper prompts for loading ip_conntrack and starting iptstate afterwards.
If the ip_conntrack is present already grml-iptstate automatically invokes
iptstate, if the module is not yet ready you will be asked whether you want
to load it (just answer with yes or no, by default yes will be assumed).
