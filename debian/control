Description: some small scripts which should make life easier
 Some scripts which should make life easier. For example:
 code2color, grml-mutt, grml-slrn, iimage, lesspipe.sh
 make_chroot_jail.sh, sepdate.pl, sepdate.rb, sepdate.sh*, wwwis.
 .
 Notice: not all the packages which are required in all the scripts
 are in the "Depends:" line. If you want to get a full featured
 grml-scripts-package install the packages from the 'Suggests' line
 too or just use the grml(-large)-system.
 .
 For more details take a look at the manpage grml-scripts.
