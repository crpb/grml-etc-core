Description: core scripts for the grml system
 This package includes some scripts for the grml system.
 .
 Whereas the main grml-scripts package is meant for use on grml
 systems only, this package can be used on plain Debian
 (stable/testing/unstable) systems as well. It is intended as a
 complement to grml-etc-core.
 .
 Currently, this package includes code2color, cpu-screen, ip-screen
 and lesspipe.sh, a more full-featured replacement for the standard
 Debian lesspipe.
 .
 For more details take a look at the grml-scripts-core manpage.
